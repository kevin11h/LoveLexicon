## Sugested Topics

* HTML/CSS
* Rails Testing (2 days of projects with testing?)
* Security
    * SQL Injection (the issue of `order`)
    * Script injection (bootstrapping, too)
* Practice doing OO design?
* Never use generators (except for migration)?
* Don't need two weeks for the projects; only need one good project.
    * Must have a guest user account.
* Should they be introduced to the DOM more gently? Like, to describe,
  the tree structure.
* They don't understand how to create new DB instances
